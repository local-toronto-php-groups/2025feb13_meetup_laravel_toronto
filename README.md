I am thrilled to confirm that Chris Sevilleja of the Laravel Cloud team will be demonstrating Laravel Cloud for us. With Q&A. 

This will be along the lines as we did with our November meet-up with Jess Archer for Laravel's Nightwatch.  

A very special thank you to Taylor and the Laravel Cloud team for making this happen. They are under big-time pressure ahead of their upcoming release date. 

Although this meet-up is in-person only, Chris will join us remotely. Please note that our meet-up maybe be recorded, transcribed, and summarized by AI. 

Schedule:

- 6:00pm to 7:00pm: meet-and-greet
- 7:00pm to 9:00pm: Laravel Cloud demo + Q&A

Thank you to Vetster for hosting, and for generously sponsoring pizza and beverages.
